  # Self-contained: the archive carries its own Java runtime, so there is no
  # depends_on "openjdk" any more. "First install Java 17" was a strange thing to
  # ask from a tool whose claim is that it needs almost nothing.
  #
  # Apple Silicon only for now. GitHub retired the Intel macOS runners, so there
  # is nothing to build an x64 archive ON -- and shipping one built elsewhere
  # would produce a runtime that looks right and does not run.

      Nothing but a GitHub token is required -- no Java, no model, no account.
      Search works with none of it; a model only makes it better:
